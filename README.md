Learning in Public: Beginner's Journey in Java & DSA
Welcome to my Learning in Public repository! This is where I document my beginner-level learning journey in Java and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). I’m just starting out, so this space will capture the basics and my growth as I learn.

Introduction
This repository is a collection of my beginner-level work:

Java Programming: Basic programs as I learn the syntax, logic, and foundational concepts.
Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA): Simple implementations of core data structures and algorithms that I’m learning step-by-step.
Everything here is part of my learning process, and by documenting it, I can reflect on my progress and share what I’ve learned with others who are also starting out.

Beginner Java Projects
Here, you'll find my first Java programs:

Simple coding exercises like loops, conditions, and basic calculations
Detailed comments explaining how each program works
Reflection on what I learned from each exercise
Basic DSA Implementations
In this section, I experiment with:

Basic data structures (arrays, stacks, queues, etc.)
Simple algorithms (sorting, searching)
Step-by-step explanations of how they work
My approach to solving problems using these structures
Learning Notes
I keep detailed notes to help with understanding:

Key Java concepts like variables, loops, and methods
Simple DSA topics with easy-to-follow explanations
Notes that explain what I’ve learned and the challenges I faced

Why I'm Learning in Public
I believe that sharing my beginner journey can
Keep me accountable and motivated
Help others who are also learning by showing that it’s okay to start from scratch
Encourage feedback from those with more experience to help me improve

How You Can Help:
As a beginner, I’d love any help I can get! Feel free to:

Provide feedback or suggestions
Point out areas where I can improve
Share resources that could help me along the way
